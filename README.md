# Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment Analysis is one of the most popular challenges in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a lot of NLP models have been developed to achieve better results. One of the biggest problems is that such models have to be trained everytime on a new dataset which is quite time consuming. 

To resolve this issue, state-of-the-art models or embeddings are pre-trained on huge text datasets that can be utilized to perform sentiment analysis on our customized datasets. This method saves a lot of time by eliminating the embedding training time and achieves high accuracy. 

We investigated the effect of two popular pre-trained word embeddings, which are GloVe and FastText, on sentiment analysis using Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) dataset 1 [9] After their critical analysis, we concluded that FastText outperformed GloVe on this dataset.

The Python Notebook demonstrates how the Sentiment Analysis was performed.
